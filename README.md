Project Title: Flappy Bird

Description:
Stay alive as long as possible.

Get Started: 
Start with designing the interface of the program with html and css.
Import all of the elements into my js file, and make the moving animation.
Add the onclick function to move the bird up and down, 
as well as a rndm function to create the holes in the barriers.
Add the game ending conditions as well. Finally for every second the score will
go up 10 and will be done counting when you die. Store the values of the score,
and add a leaderboard. Afterwards style as needed.
