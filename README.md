Project Title: Flappy Bird

Description:
You must survive the obstacles as long as possible. Upon death a pop up 
screen with your score you earned and your high score. Will include a leaderboard.

Get Started: 
I will start with designing the interface of the program with html and css.
Import all of the elements into my js file, and make the moving animation.
Add the onclick function to move the bird up and down, 
as well as a rndm function to create the holes in the barriers.
Add the game ending conditions as well. Finally for every second the score will
go up 10 and will be done counting when you die. Store the values of the score,
and add a leaderboard. Afterwards style as needed.
